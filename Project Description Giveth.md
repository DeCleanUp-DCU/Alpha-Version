## Basic Details
We are building a blockchain-based platform to incentivize and reward global environmental cleanup efforts through digital assets. The Decentralized Cleanup (DeCleanup) leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent and verifiable system for rewarding individuals and communities for their environmental cleanup efforts. Participants will use a decentralized application (DApp) to document cleanups, submit evidence, and receive digital assets as rewards. This initiative aims to foster global participation in environmental stewardship, with plans to scale and integrate into broader blockchain ecosystems.

### Funding Allocation
- **70%** for the development of blockchain infrastructure (DCU NFT, $DCU reward), the decentralized application (DApp), community engagement efforts, marketing campaigns, and operational logistics required for the pilot program.
- **30%** for further development of in-real-life cleanup operations, supporting participants, ensuring decentralized cleanups are organized worldwide at least once a month on Monthly Earth Day (every 22nd of the month).

Our approach uniquely combines environmental initiatives and blockchain technology to create a scalable, incentivized cleanup model. This project will be open-source and the sources will be available on our GitHub page.

## Team
DeCleanUp was incubated in GreenPill Phangan team, as a project rewarding participants of local cleanups and sponsoring them with supplies. With time, it has grown as a separate entity as we are aiming to a global scale. Current development is powered by EcoSynthesisX.

## Roadmap and Milestones
To date, we have completed initial planning and some community outreach worldwide. Preliminary development of the blockchain infrastructure and DApp prototype is underway, with feedback mechanisms established to ensure continuous improvement.

### Milestone 1: DCU NFT Development
- **Deliverables**: Multichain dynamic NFT collection, playing as a reward system of 10 stages, blockchain frameworks, smart contract development, and initial testing.
- **Duration**: 2 months

#### NFT Collection
The alpha version of the DeCleanUP (DCU) NFT collection comprises a series of dynamic, multichain NFTs designed to incentivize and reward participants for their environmental cleanup efforts.
- **Dynamic NFTs**: Each NFT can be upgraded as users complete and provide Proof of Impact with more cleanups, showcasing their commitment and progress in environmental stewardship.
- **Multichain Compatibility**: The NFTs are compatible across multiple blockchain networks, including Optimism, Base, Celo, and Arbitrum, ensuring wide accessibility and use.
- **Unique Designs**: The NFTs feature unique, cleanup-themed artwork, highlighted with Impact Value, $DCU points and level (newbie, pro, hero, guardian).

#### Traits
- **Category**: Cleanup NFT (same for all)
- **Type**: Dynamic (same for all)
- **Impact**: Environment (same for all)
- **Rarity**: Common 1-3, Rare 4-6, Legendary 7-9, Unique 10
- **Impact Value**: 1 (2, 3, 4, 5...)
- **$DCU**: 10 (20, 30, 40...)
- **Level**: Newbie 1-3, Pro 4-6, Hero 7-9, Guardian 10

### Milestone 2: Development and Pilot Launch
- **Deliverables**: Claiming reward DApp, user guides, and pilot program execution.
- **Duration**: 3 months

### Milestone 3: Marketing and Community Engagement
- **Deliverables**: Marketing campaign, community outreach activities, and engagement metrics.
- **Duration**: 3-6 months

### Milestone 4: Future Collaborations
- **Deliverables**: Implementing collaborative joint programs and campaigns with existing cleanup organizations and incentive platforms (e.g. OpenLitterMap, Cleanify, Monthly Earth Day by Highly Artistic, wetrybetter by Jerri.nft).
- **Duration**: 6 months

### Milestone 5: Enhancing Verification System in Steps
- **Deliverables**: Integrate with third-party platforms for cross-verification, engage with impact metrics providers for the best results of impact validation, potentially reach automated verification tools and develop machine learning and image recognition, security measures for Sybil attacks.
- **Duration**: 1 year

## Conclusion
This solution promotes environmental stewardship by incentivizing cleanup efforts through blockchain technology, fostering a global community of environmentally conscious individuals and organizations. By integrating with broader blockchain ecosystems, it enhances the overall impact and reach of blockchain technology for public goods.
