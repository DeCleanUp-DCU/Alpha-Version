### Basic Details

DeCleanup Network is a blockchain-based platform designed to incentivize and reward global environmental cleanup efforts through digital assets. By leveraging blockchain technology, DeCleanup creates a transparent and verifiable system for rewarding individuals and communities for their environmental contributions. Participants use a decentralized application (DApp) to document cleanups, submit evidence, and receive digital assets as rewards. This initiative aims to foster global participation in environmental stewardship, with plans to scale and integrate into broader blockchain ecosystems.

### What Has Been Done

#### DApp and Dynamic NFT Collection

To date, we have launched the test dApp on the Arbitrum chain. You can visit the test page [here](https://dcutest.netlify.app/). The mint will be live on 09.08.2024 on [Decleanup.Net](https://decleanup.net).

The main feature of our rewards program is the collection of dynamic NFTs, themed around cleanup activities and designed to incentivize and reward participants for their environmental cleanup efforts. Each NFT reward can be upgraded (with 10 steps of progress) as users provide photos from different cleanup events.

The collection items have common traits that remain consistent with each NFT upgrade:
- **Category**: Cleanup NFT
- **Type**: Dynamic
- **Impact**: Environment

There are dynamic traits, which grow every three cleanups:
- **Rarity**: Common (1-3 cleanups), Rare (4-6 cleanups), Legendary (7-9 cleanups), Unique (10 cleanups)
- **Level**: Newbie (1-3 cleanups), Pro (4-6 cleanups), Hero (7-9 cleanups), Guardian (10 cleanups)

And dynamic traits which grow with every cleanup done:
- **Impact Value**: 1 (first cleanup) to 10 (last cleanup)
- **DCU Points**: 10 (first cleanup) to 100 (last cleanup)

While the first two categories of traits determine the general information required for this product’s classification on the Impact Marketplace, and also gives the ranking to the user, the last category are main dynamic traits, which will determine the value of the NFT on the Impact Marketplace in the future and user’s onchain rank.

#### Establishing Initial Partnerships

We have also completed community outreach planned for the first stage. The conversation was recorded on [X space](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwGWNjjQOqKQ), where we discussed the vision for DeCleanup Network development with partners around the world. There is also a detailed article on [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/0x173D87dfa68aEB0E821C6021f5652B9C3a7556b4/ZzncKRu-Q-leEZkQ48Txm-NQRxG_hH3V3wyHaYUKfY).

We have established our first line of partners to drive our marketing campaign. Main partners include communities committed to organizing at least one cleanup a month, ideally on Monthly Earth Day, to support the environmental movement started by Crypto Whales NFT - [Highly Artistic](https://x.com/highlyartistic?s=21). These community leaders will receive a comprehensive guide on using the DeCleanup Rewards dApp and will get first-hand support necessary for the initial stage. They will then pass this knowledge to the next layer of users.

Our first partners in this category are GreenPill Phangan and ReFi Phangan, who are among the most active participants in the Monthly Earth Day movement. You can see their latest cleanup report [here](https://x.com/refiphangan/status/1815683299542761801?s=61).

Another partner, [Aqua Purge web3](https://x.com/aquapurgeweb3?s=21), organized a significant three-location [cleanup in Kenya](https://x.com/decentracleanup/status/1813189876155883700?s=61) for Monthly Earth Day in July. They are planning to start community onboarding to DeCleanup rewards and other incentives from our partners.

Additionally, we have ReFi Tulum, who consistently support Monthly Earth Day and are eager to introduce their community to crypto incentives. Their latest cleanup report can be found [here](https://x.com/refitulum/status/1815469046550479276?s=61).

We also collaborate with projects that create various cleanup incentives. For example, DeCleanup and [Cleanify](https://x.com/cleanify_vet?s=21) have a collaborative strategy to promote each other, motivating both communities to organize more cleanups, and providing additional incentives for them.

### What Needs To Be Done

The roadmap in the image provides a step-by-step plan for the DeCleanup Network’s development and expansion:

1. **Launch (9.08.2024)**: The project begins with its initial launch on the Arbitrum chain, introducing first three levels of rewards to incentivize early participants.

2. **Communities Activation (22.09.2024)**: This phase focuses on finishing onboarding of partners onboard, including both leaders and participants, to establish a foundation for the network's growth.

3. **Marketing (Q4 2024)**: Marketing efforts aim to engage communities, drive participation, build partnerships, and promote key initiatives like Monthly Earth Day events.

4. **Expansion (Q2 2025)**: The platform eventually expands to multiple blockchain networks, increasing its reach and involving more global communities and partners.

5. **DeCleanup 2.0 (Q4 2025)**: This final phase involves the full rollout of the platform with all planned features, evaluating performance, refining strategies, and ensuring the project’s sustainability for long-term success.

### Conclusion

DeCleanup Network promotes environmental stewardship by incentivizing cleanup efforts through blockchain technology, fostering a global community of environmentally conscious individuals and organizations. By integrating with broader blockchain ecosystems, it enhances the overall impact and reach of blockchain technology for public goods.
