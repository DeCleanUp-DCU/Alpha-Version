**DeCleanup Rewards** is a decentralized application (dApp) build on Arbitrum and designed to a) **tokenize irl impact cerated via global/local cleanup efforts** and b) **incentivize environmental actions via DeFi mechanics**. The platform promotes environmental stewardship globally, with plans to activate global/local communities and scale across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

## Uniqueness 

**How DeCleanup dApp works** Participants do cleanups, submit proofs (photo), and earn dynamic NFTs that evolve based on their contributions. Read more details here https://mirror.xyz/decleanupnet.eth/ZzncKRu-Q-leEZkQ48Txm-NQRxG_hH3V3wyHaYUKfYI

**Gasless approach** We chose Arbitrum chain for low gas fees, made only first level claimâ€™s gas fees paid by user and the rest of dynamic experience is gasless. (!)

**User-Centric Design & Functionality**: DeCleanup dApp offers a user-friendly experience with an intuitive UI. It allows individuals and communities to easily apply proofs of cleanup activities and earn dynamic NFTs as onchain represintaion of IRL impact and be rewarded with DCU points (futher convertable). The verification system is built in a way that users proof can be quickly verified to get the reward.

## dApp and Dynamic NFT Collection

![9 Levels NFTs](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZELVjF8H5VvG1BxhunXK4n6LuK17RBuis5yRepEqxARk)

The collection items have common traits that remain consistent with each NFT upgrade:
- **Category**: Cleanup Impact NFT
- **Type**: Dynamic
- **Impact**: Environmental

There are dynamic traits, which grow every three cleanups:
- **Rarity**: Common (1-3 cleanups), Rare (4-6 cleanups), Legendary (7-9 cleanups), Unique (10 cleanups)
- **Level**: Newbie (1-3 cleanups), Pro (4-6 cleanups), Hero (7-9 cleanups), Guardian (10 cleanups)

And dynamic traits which grow with every cleanup done:
- **Impact Value**: 1 (first cleanup) to 10 (last cleanup)
- **DCU Points**: 10 (first cleanup) to 100 (last cleanup)

While the first two categories of traits determine the general information required for this impact productâ€™s classification on the Impact Marketplace, the last categories are mainly dynamic traits, which will determine the rewards value via Impact Marketplace DeFi utility and will contribute for userâ€™s IRL impact rank.

## Partnerships and Community Activation

+ Initial community outreach was established by partnering with key networks such as GreenPill Phangan and ReFi Phangan, which are active in the Monthly Earth Day movement. Additional partnerships with Aqua Purge web3, ReFi Tulum, and HEMJapan have furthered our global reach. These networks organize regular cleanups and contribute to the growing momentum of the DeCleanup initiative. (!) Ssilochek moget dobavit' esli est' (!)

Notably, [HEMJapan](https://x.com/hemjapan?s=21) impressed with 12 new wallets already participating in our rewards system. 

+ Collaboration with like minded projects. As example, DeCleanup and [Cleanify](https://x.com/cleanify_vet?s=21) have a collaborative strategy to promote each other, motivating both communities to organize more cleanups, and providing additional incentives for them.
