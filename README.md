DeCleanup Network is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to incentivize global environmental cleanup efforts through digital assets. Participants document cleanups, submit evidence, and earn dynamic NFTs that evolve based on their contributions. The platform promotes environmental stewardship globally, with plans to scale across multiple blockchain ecosystems.

# DeCleanup Network Description

**User-Centric Design & Functionality**: DeCleanup offers a user-friendly experience with an intuitive DApp that allows individuals and communities to easily document their cleanup activities and earn dynamic NFTs as rewards. The verification system is built in a way that users can relatively quickly get verified and claim the reward. We chose Arbitrum chain for low gas fees, made only first level claim’s gas fees paid by user and the rest of dynamic experience is gasless. . 

**Contribution to Ecosystem Growth**: By driving environmental action and integrating blockchain technology, DeCleanup encourages global participation, boosting new wallets activity and community engagement.

**Innovation in Application**: The platform uses NFTs that evolve with each contribution, combined with leaderboards and gamification via [Guild XYZ](https://guild.xyz/decleanup-network) giving users interactive ways to earn additional points while supporting our community campaign. The top of the leaderboard will make it to whitelist.

# What Has Been Done

## DApp and Dynamic NFT Collection

![9 Levels NFTs](https://beige-defiant-spoonbill-537.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZELVjF8H5VvG1BxhunXK4n6LuK17RBuis5yRepEqxARk)

The collection items have common traits that remain consistent with each NFT upgrade:
- **Category**: Cleanup NFT
- **Type**: Dynamic
- **Impact**: Environment

There are dynamic traits, which grow every three cleanups:
- **Rarity**: Common (1-3 cleanups), Rare (4-6 cleanups), Legendary (7-9 cleanups), Unique (10 cleanups)
- **Level**: Newbie (1-3 cleanups), Pro (4-6 cleanups), Hero (7-9 cleanups), Guardian (10 cleanups)

And dynamic traits which grow with every cleanup done:
- **Impact Value**: 1 (first cleanup) to 10 (last cleanup)
- **DCU Points**: 10 (first cleanup) to 100 (last cleanup)

While the first two categories of traits determine the general information required for this product’s classification on the Impact Marketplace, and also gives the ranking to the user, the last category are main dynamic traits, which will determine the value of the NFT on the Impact Marketplace in the future and user’s onchain rank.

## Establishing Initial Partnerships

We have completed initial community outreach, partnering with key networks such as GreenPill Phangan and ReFi Phangan, which are active in the Monthly Earth Day movement. Additional partnerships with Aqua Purge web3, ReFi Tulum, and HEMJapan have furthered our global reach. These networks organize regular cleanups and contribute to the growing momentum of the DeCleanup initiative.

Notably, [HEMJapan](https://x.com/hemjapan?s=21) impressed with 12 new wallets already participating in our rewards system. 

We also collaborate with projects that create various cleanup incentives. For example, DeCleanup and [Cleanify](https://x.com/cleanify_vet?s=21) have a collaborative strategy to promote each other, motivating both communities to organize more cleanups, and providing additional incentives for them.
